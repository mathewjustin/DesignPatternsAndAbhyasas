## How https works and what is .cer certificate?
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for communication between a web browser and a web server. It adds an extra layer of security by encrypting the data exchanged between the client (browser) and the server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

Here's a high-level overview of how HTTPS works:

Client initiates a secure connection: The client (web browser) sends a request to the server using the HTTPS protocol (typically on port 443).

Server presents a certificate: The server responds with a digital certificate, typically in the form of a .cer or .pem file. The certificate contains the server's public key, along with information about the certificate issuer and validity.

Client verifies the certificate: The client verifies the authenticity of the certificate by checking its digital signature against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The CA is a trusted third party that issues and verifies digital certificates.

Client generates a session key: If the certificate is valid, the client generates a unique session key and encrypts it using the server's public key from the certificate. This session key will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged during the secure connection.

Secure connection established: The encrypted session key is sent to the server, which decrypts it using its private key. The client and server now share a secret session key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt data during the secure connection.

Secure data exchange: From this point onward, the client and server use the session key to encrypt and decrypt all data transmitted over the secure connection, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

Now, let's address the .cer certificate:

A .cer certificate is a file format used to store digital certificates. It contains information about an entity (such as a website or organization) and its corresponding public key. The certificate is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and is used in HTTPS to establish a secure connection.

The .cer certificate file includes details such as the server's domain name, organization name, certificate expiration date, public key, and digital signature. It is an essential component of the SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocol used to establish secure connections.

When a client (web browser) receives a .cer certificate from a server during the HTTPS handshake, it uses the certificate to verify the server's identity and ensure secure communication.

In summary, HTTPS uses digital certificates (such as .cer files) to establish secure connections, encrypt data, and ensure the authenticity and integrity of the communication between clients and servers.



##Why i need to add it to keystore of java?
Adding a certificate to the Java keystore is necessary in certain situations to establish trust between the client (Java application) and the server.

When a Java application connects to a server using HTTPS, it verifies the authenticity and integrity of the server's digital certificate. This verification process relies on the Java keystore, which contains a collection of trusted certificates.

Here are a few reasons why you might need to add a certificate to the Java keystore:

Certificate Chain Verification: The server's digital certificate may be issued by an intermediate Certificate Authority (CA) rather than a trusted root CA. In such cases, the Java keystore needs to contain the intermediate CA certificate to establish the trust chain. If the intermediate CA certificate is not present in the keystore, the client may fail to establish a secure connection.

Self-Signed Certificates: Self-signed certificates are issued by the server itself, without the involvement of a trusted CA. These certificates are not automatically trusted by the client's Java runtime. To establish trust with a self-signed certificate, you need to manually add the certificate to the Java keystore.

Custom or Internal CA: If your organization uses a custom or internal Certificate Authority to issue server certificates, the CA's root or intermediate certificate needs to be added to the Java keystore. This ensures that the Java application recognizes and trusts the server certificates issued by your organization's CA.

By adding the necessary certificates to the Java keystore, you enable the Java runtime to validate the server's certificate and establish a secure connection. It allows the Java application to verify the authenticity and integrity of the server, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring secure communication.


##How is it different from browsers?

The process of establishing trust and managing certificates in Java applications differs from that in web browsers. Here are a few key differences:

Certificate Trust Store: Browsers and Java applications maintain separate trust stores for managing certificates. Browsers have their own trust store, which includes a list of trusted root Certificate Authorities (CAs) pre-installed by the browser vendor. Java applications, on the other hand, use the Java keystore to manage certificates.

Default Trusted CAs: Browsers come with a predefined list of trusted root CAs, often referred to as the "Root Certificate Program." This list is regularly updated by browser vendors to include well-known CAs. Java installations, by default, rely on the underlying operating system's trusted root CAs for certificate verification.

Certificate Management: Browsers typically handle certificate management automatically for end-users. They perform certificate validation, including checking for expiration, revocation, and matching domain names. If a certificate cannot be verified or has expired, browsers display warning messages to users. In Java applications, certificate management is typically performed programmatically by developers, who have more control and flexibility over the validation process.

Self-Signed Certificates: Browsers often display warnings or errors when encountering self-signed certificates, as they are not issued by a trusted CA. Users are typically required to explicitly accept the risk and proceed. In Java applications, self-signed certificates need to be manually added to the Java keystore to establish trust. Developers have the ability to configure certificate verification based on their specific requirements.

Certificate Pinning: Browsers support certificate pinning, which allows a website to specify a set of public key hashes or exact certificate details that the browser should expect. This provides an additional layer of security against fraudulent certificates. Java applications also support certificate pinning, but the implementation and management are typically handled within the application code.

Overall, while both browsers and Java applications use certificates for secure communication, the management and trust establishment processes differ. Browsers provide a user-friendly interface for certificate validation and trust, while Java applications require manual management and configuration by developers using the Java keystore.
