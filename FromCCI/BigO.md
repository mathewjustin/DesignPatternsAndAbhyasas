**Time Complexity**

Electronic Transfer : O(s), where s is the size of the file. This means that time to transfer the files
increases linearly with the size of the file.

Airplane Transfer: O(1), with respect to the size of the file. As the size of the file increases , it wont take any longer to get the file to your friend.
The time is constant. 

So airplane transfer is still better for 20TB file to be delivered
from Bangalore to Mumbai within in a day.
