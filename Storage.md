**Database.**

Data persistence is a crucial aspect of databases as it ensures that information remains intact even when a computer or server encounters a shutdown. When a database writes data into memory structures such as Hashcodes, Arrays, or Hashtables, there is a risk of data loss if the server experiences a failure and requires a restart. This is because the data stored in memory is volatile and not durable in the face of unexpected interruptions.

To address this issue, databases employ disk storage, which refers to either Hard Disk Drives (HDD) or Solid-State Drives (SSD). Disk storage provides non-volatility, meaning that data persists even in the event of power loss or system shutdown. While SSDs offer faster performance, they tend to be more expensive. HDDs, on the other hand, are suitable for storing rarely accessed data over an extended period, whereas SSDs excel at handling frequently accessed data due to their superior speed.

In contrast to disk storage, memory, specifically Random Access Memory (RAM), is volatile in nature. Any data stored in RAM is susceptible to loss when the process responsible for managing that data ceases to exist or encounters an error.

The term "persistent storage" typically refers to disk storage, but it can encompass any type of storage medium that retains data even if the managing process terminates unexpectedly. By leveraging persistent storage, databases can ensure the durability and availability of data, safeguarding it from being lost due to system failures or crashes.
